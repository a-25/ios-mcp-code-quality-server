# Removed Tests Documentation

This file documents tests that were removed during the test quality improvement initiative to explain the rationale for future maintainers.

## orchestrateTask.test.ts - REMOVED

**Reason for Removal:** Heavy mocking without meaningful validation

**Issues Found:**
- All tests were heavily mocked using `vi.mock()` and only tested mock return values
- Tests replicated the same mock assertion patterns across multiple test cases
- No actual business logic validation - just verifying that mocked functions returned mocked values
- Prevented validation of the actual implementation logic

**Original Test Coverage:**
- 6 tests checking success/error handling for TestFix and LintFix operations
- All tests followed the pattern: mock function → call function → assert mocked return value

**Coverage Replacement:**
- Core orchestration logic is tested through integration tests in `e2eAiIntegration.test.ts`
- Individual component logic is tested in focused test files like `testRunner.test.ts`
- Real functionality validation occurs in other test files without excessive mocking

## Test Pattern Issues Addressed

**Before:** Tests that mock the implementation and assert on the mocks
```typescript
(handleTestFixLoop as any).mockResolvedValue({ success: true, data: "ok" });
const result = await handleTestFixLoop(validOptions);
expect(result.success).toBe(true); // Just testing the mock!
```

**After:** Tests that validate actual logic and behavior
```typescript
const result = await runTestsAndParseFailures(options, mockSpawnOutput);
expect(result.buildErrors.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
expect(result.buildErrors[0]).toContain("The following build commands failed:");
```

## Other Test Improvements Made

### testRunner.test.ts
- **Before:** 12+ tests mostly testing response formatting with complex mock data extraction
- **After:** 3 focused tests on core parsing and categorization logic
- **Removed:** Trivial formatting tests, redundant mock data parsing, string template validation

### aiEnhancements.test.ts
- **Before:** 8 tests with extensive redundancy in formatting validation
- **After:** 4 focused test groups covering essential AI enhancement functionality
- **Removed:** Duplicate formatting tests, trivial string matching tests

### uiTestDetection.test.ts
- **Before:** 8 test groups mostly validating string patterns and enum values
- **After:** 2 focused test groups on data structure validation and categorization
- **Removed:** Trivial pattern matching tests, obvious enum value checks
